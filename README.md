# Akeno

## Overview

A probably badly written x64 UEFI operating system, to learn how it all works.

The `build.bat` is a mess, it required WSL and only god knows what packages. Run it and let it scream, then fix it.

## Credit

Within `deps/` there is a file named `ovmf.fd`, this is not mine. It is a debug x64 build of OVMF from https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
